Life is good
life is bad
life's so tough it makes you sad
When i'm down
all alone 
I scroll through youtube on my phone

I've watched so much
I've watched it all
I've watched the spring turn into fall
it's not enough
it never is
who'd have thought I'd live like this

Now im done
in the end
I draft a message, never send
The night is cold 
the night is long
I record myself sing ing a song

I feel so cold
I feel so tired
I wait a moment in the quiet
I get undressed
go to bed
cover up my sleepy head

A new day comes
its bright and grey
I think about my life today
Of getting up
and going out
to learn what this life's all about

But alas
I cannot win
I'm still at home I'm staying in 
Another day
a mournful tone
another night spent on my phone...
